            <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus; /ˈtʃiːtə/) is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae that occurs in North, Southern and East Africa, and a few localities in Iran. It inhabits a variety of mostly arid habitats like dry forests, scrub forests, and savannahs. The species is IUCN Red Listed as Vulnerable, as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to habitat loss, poaching for the illegal pet trade, and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.</p>
            <p>Much to the public's dismay, there's been a succesful population installed in the northeast corner of the United States. They've made use of very unorthodox ways to survive. They were busted and publicly shamed for observing the local Rams migration patterns. Not to be overlooked, the ever-aging Alpha male likes his balls flat. Quite disgusting you asked me. It was recently discovered to have a new natural predator: Eagles. So be warned, they may be recording you without you knowing.</p>
